/**
 * This "BuiltinDefaultCode" provides the "default code" functionality as used in the "Benchtop Test."
 *
 * The BuiltinDefaultCode extends the IterativeRobot base class to provide the "default code"
 * functionality to confirm the operation and usage of the core control system components, as
 * used in the "Benchtop Test" described in Chapter 2 of the 2009 FRC Control System Manual.
 *
 * This program provides features in the Disabled, Autonomous, and Teleop modes as described
 * in the benchtop test directions, including "once-a-second" debugging printouts when disabled,
 * a "KITT light show" on the solenoid lights when in autonomous, and elementary driving
 * capabilities and "button mapping" of joysticks when teleoperated.  This demonstration
 * program also shows the use of the MotorSafety timer.
 *
 * This demonstration is not intended to serve as a "starting template" for development of
 * robot code for a team, as there are better templates and examples created specifically
 * for that purpose.  However, teams may find the techniques used in this program to be
 * interesting possibilities for use in their own robot code.
 *
 * The details of the behavior provided by this demonstration are summarized below:
 *
 * Disabled Mode:
 * - Once per second, print (on the console) the number of seconds the robot has been disabled.
 *
 * Autonomous Mode:
 * - Flash the solenoid lights like KITT in Knight Rider
 * - Example code (commented out by default) to drive forward at half-speed for 2 seconds
 *
 * Teleop Mode:
 * - Select between two different drive options depending upon Z-location of Joystick1
 * - When "Z-Up" (on Joystick1) provide "arcade drive" on Joystick1
 * - When "Z-Down" (on Joystick1) provide "tank drive" on Joystick1 and Joystick2
 * - Use Joystick buttons (on Joystick1 or Joystick2) to display the button number in binary on
 *   the solenoid LEDs (Note that this feature can be used to easily "map out" the buttons on a
 *   Joystick.  Note also that if multiple buttons are pressed simultaneously, a "15" is displayed
 *   on the solenoid LEDs to indicate that multiple buttons are pressed.)
 *
 * This code assumes the following connections:
 * - Driver Station:
 *   - USB 1 - The "right" joystick.  Used for either "arcade drive" or "right" stick for tank drive
 *   - USB 2 - The "left" joystick.  Used as the "left" stick for tank drive
 *
 * - Robot:
 *   - Digital Sidecar 1:
 *     - PWM 1/3 - Connected to "left" drive motor(s)
 *     - PWM 2/4 - Connected to "right" drive motor(s)
